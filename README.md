pygdrived
=========

A Google Drive daemon written in Python for Unix and Unix work-alikes (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, etc.). It is licensed under terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0. See LICENSE.txt for details.

 This could also theoretically work for Mac OS X, but there would be little point in using it since offical Google Drive software already exists from Google.

TODO: Auto handshake (don't require user to copy/paste code).

TODO: Only check authorization with Google Oauth once.

TODO: Save initial setup authorization in ~/.config/pygdrived directory.

TODO: Implement as daemon.

TODO: Package required google packages in an .egg file for easier distribution and installation.

TODO: Maybe build a simple Tk of Qt GUI for configuration purposes?

TODO: Figure out how to create a notification bar icon (ala Dropbox for Nautilus). Make this Desktop Manager agnostic, if at all possible.
